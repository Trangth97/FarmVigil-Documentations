Mosaic Tool 
===========

This tool allows the user to mosaic by manually choosing cutlines between images before mosaicing. 

Click |mosaic_tool| icon on toolbar to start use tool:

.. |mosaic_tool| image:: ../icon/mosaic_tool.png

.. image:: ../img/imagery/mosaic_manual_tool.png
    :align: center 

Create
******

Users want to create mosaic preparation manually with given choices.

Step 1: Click Create Mosaic Preparation button  

.. image:: ../img/prepare_mosaic/create_prepare_mosaic_1.png
    :align: center 

Step 2: Type data:

1. Type Name
2. Select images from list images, at least 2 images (Search image from list)

.. image:: ../img/prepare_mosaic/create_prepare_mosaic_2.png
    :align: center 

3. Select cutline method 

.. image:: ../img/prepare_mosaic/create_prepare_mosaic_3.png
    :align: center 

- **Minimum Squared Difference**: A cutline is determined in each overlapped area between two adjacent images, with minimum square difference of gray values at the same locations of the region. 
- **Minimum Difference**: A cutline is determined in each overlapped area between two adjacent images, with minimum difference of gray values at the same locations of the region.
- **Edge**: Provides better output in urban-area mosaicking, or in images containing many linear features. The objective is to avoid placing cutlines across linear features.
- **Maximum Data**: Places cutlines on the boundary of the real image pixels, meaning that NoData pixels will be ignored when the image boundary is determined.

**Note**: Avoid placing cutlines on any of the following:

- Buildings or man-made features, because they can lean in different directions in the imagery
- Large bodies of water, because waves and the color of the water can differ among the various images
- Areas that are significantly different in color and texture, such as forests and cultivated land, because they, too, can differ image to image 

4. Check Simplify Cutlines, if not check, skip (5)
5. Type Simplification Level
6. Select Color Balancing Method: Color balancing evens out the color contrasts from one image to another to reduce the visibility of the seams and produce a mosaic that is appealing visually. There are 4 methods:

.. image:: ../img/prepare_mosaic/create_prepare_mosaic_4.png
    :align: center 

- **Bundle**: firstly, all overlapping image areas after removing anomalies in the data will compute the statistics. A bundle color adjustment (both the mean and sigma of the brightness and contrast) is applied to minimize the overall difference between all overlapping areas. Secondly, the remaining differences are modified with dodging.
- **Overlap**: computes the color-balancing histogram using only the pixels in the overlapping area of the images being added to the mosaic file.
- **Histogram**: Builds histograms for each image starting from the center of the mosaic, determines the optimum radiometry for the input image from the data then applies the transformation to the entire image.
- **Neighborhood**: using all surrounding images to modify the gain and bias of the histogram, regardless of their z-order (based on sorting order) and works iteratively to modify neighboring pixels.

7. Click Generate button

.. |reclass_toolset| image:: ../icon/reclass_toolset.png

* Choose image -> Click |reclass_toolset| icon:

  - Equal interval: the method divides the range of values into equal-sized subranges.
  - Quantile: the method will assign the same number of values to each class. There are no empty classes or classes with too few or too many values. This method works well with the linearly distributed data.

Mosaic
******

This tool supports merge/ combination list of images into a single image automatically. It is similar to advanced mosaics with different algorithms.

Orthorectify
************

Orthorectify is the process of removing the effects of terrain and sensor creating a planimetrically correct image. The image will match the spatial by considering location, elevation and sensor information.
 
5. Matching band
6. Number of GCPs: Type the number of points that you want to collect over each image
7. Minimum acceptance score: enter a value from 0-1 which defines the minimum correlation score that will be considered a successful match.
8. There are two Matching method:
    - FFTP: Fast Fourier Transform Phase Matching: when two images have a relative shift between them, the result is a phase difference in the Fourier domain. FFTP determines the shift between images using this phase difference.
    - NCC: Normalized Cross Correlation. This method finds the relative shift between two images by finding the shift that produces the maximum cross-correlation coefficient of the gray values in the images. 
9. Search radius: type a number to define the search radius around the kernel
